    "answer": "Based on the BERT sentiment analysis over time:\n\n\u2022 **Positive Sentiment**: Shows a increasing trend (slope: 0.0048 per year, R\u00b2 = 0.018). Positive sentiment changed from 20.0% to 26.5% (+6.5% change). This trend is not statistically significant.\n\u2022 **Negative Sentiment**: Shows a increasing trend (slope: 0.0283 per year, R\u00b2 = 0.745). Negative sentiment changed from 27.3% to 38.9% (+11.6% change). This trend is statistically significant (p < 0.05).\n\n**Key Observations**: Currently, negative sentiment (38.9%) exceeds positive sentiment (26.5%), indicating that recent discussions may reflect ongoing challenges or unmet needs in the menopause community.",
