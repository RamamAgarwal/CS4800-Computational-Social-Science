Suggested research questions:
1. How do trends in positive/negative sentiment change over years, and are there significant shifts around specific events?
2. How do BERT and VADER disagree systematically (e.g., on sarcasm, specialty vocabulary)?
3. Are certain topics (from LDA) associated with consistently higher negative sentiment?
4. Do subtopics show different sentiment dynamics compared to main topics?
5. Is there a relationship between comment volume and sentiment (e.g., spikes of negativity with higher activity)?
6. Can we detect temporal clusters of sentiment changes that align with real-world events or policy changes?
7. How well do automatic sentiment labels align with manual annotation on a small sample?
8. Are there user- or community-level differences in sentiment (e.g., by subreddit or poster)?
9. Does sentiment predict subsequent engagement (replies, upvotes) controlling for topic?
10. Is topic prevalence shifting over time and does that explain sentiment shifts?
